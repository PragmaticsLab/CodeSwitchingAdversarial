<h1>ATIS - Seven Languages</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">LDC2021T04</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>ATIS - Seven Languages, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)   Catalog Number 
LDC2021T04 and ISBN 1-58563-954-0, was developed by Amazon Web Services, Inc. and consists of translation and annotation of 
ATIS (Air Travel Information Services) corpora, specifically <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S5">ATIS2 (LDC93S5)</a>, <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC94S19">ATIS3 Training Data (LDC94S19)</a>, and <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC95S26">ATIS3 Test Data (LDC95S26)</a> into 
  six languages: Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. </p>
<p>The ATIS collection was developed to support the research and development of speech understanding systems. Participants were presented with various hypothetical travel planning scenarios and asked to solve them by interacting with partially or completely automated ATIS systems. The resulting utterances were recorded and transcribed. Data was collected in the early 1990s at five US sites: Raytheon BBN, Carnegie Mellon University, MIT Laboratory of Computer Science, National Institute for Standards and Technology, and SRI International.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data is separated into 4,978 utterances for training and 893 utterances for testing following the original ATIS division. The training set contains 4,978 utterances selected from the Class A (context independent) training data in the ATIS2 and ATIS3 corpora. The test set contains 893 utterances from the November 1993 and December 1994 data sets in ATIS3.</p>
<p>The original English utterances were manually translated into the six languages. This release also indicates the original English utterance. Each utterance is annotated with named entities via table lookup; markers include city, airline, airport names and dates.   </p>
<p>Data is  stored in UTF-8 encoded tab separated value files.</p>
